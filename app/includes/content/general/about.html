  		<h2>Description</h2>
  		<p>Evoked from the muggy swamp-land that is St. Petersburg Florida in 2001, Sound-Skrapes could accurately be described as a massive collage of nightmarish soundscapes sucked into rhythmic disasters or perhaps the other way around. Your worst fears tunneling through your mind trying to burst through your skull and devour you alive. The minimal avant-garde endeavors of the prolific Riki Rezinunts (Gross National Produkt, Thee Rezinunts Muzik Projekt, Brother Cement, Blood Ties, and more) combines many methods of noise to conjure alienated ambient sound structures. Through the use of many synthesis techniques, some home-made equipment, tape loops, analog &amp; digital equipment, and (un)natural sample sources Sound-Skrapes creates a world of futuristic desolation, savagery and lawlessness through the eyes of a tortured, dying, and ravaged digital race.</p>

  		<h2>Biography</h2>
  		<p>Sound-Skrapes started off as a previous incarnation known as Analytic Cubism back in the mid 90’s that focused on fusing modern electronics and structures with traditionally experimental and almost organic industrial in the veins of Throbbing Gristle, early Coil, Whitehouse, etc. After this short-lived project was laid to rest to focus on other avenues of artistic expression, Riki started to look back on the idea of creating such (anti)art again, years later.</p>

		<p>In 2001 a Sound-Skrapes track, ‘Fade To End’ was realized and it was later decided to release it on a upcoming GNP album, ‘Enslave’. It appeared as a kind of outro/exit track and was quite different than the rest of the albums modern dance-floor industrial vibe. This track was later revised by Akoustik Timbre Frekuency (Priapus23) and renamed to “ATFading In” which later appeared as the intro to Sound-Skrapes debut album.</p>

		<p>In October of 2004 the debut album of Sound-Skrapes, “Kode” had been completed. This serves as somewhat of a conceptual album and tells the story of a fairly advanced digital civilization fading out of existence because their advanced and superior technology that they were so dependent upon ultimately became their undoing.</p>

		<p>The following album, “Dementia Disease Process” was later released in May of 2007 in observance of and as a homage to National Mental Awareness Month. Much more spontaneous and “unscripted” than the previous album, it has more of a free-style brap session feel throughout.</p>

		<p>Sound-Skrapes has had a long period of inactivity since the last release but there is still more to come as Riki prepares to unleash the latest Sound-Skrapes offering, “Mourn the Loss, Keep the Hate” in late 2011.</p>
